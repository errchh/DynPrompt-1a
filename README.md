# DynPrompt-1a

This project showcases my learning from the Python with Gen AI course. I've implemented a simple chatbot that uses natural language processing techniques to respond to user input.

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of machine learning and AI concepts in Python. I've used the course materials as a starting point and added my own features and ideas.

## Key Features

* Implemented a simple chatbot using NLTK and scikit-learn libraries
* Used a pre-trained language model to generate responses
* Implemented a web interface using Flask

## Technical Details

* Python version: 3.11
* Libraries used: ollama-python
* Dependencies required: pandas 

## Usage and Installation

pip install ollama 
ollama pull llama3.1:latest 

pip install pandas

## Examples and Screenshots

Check out the chatbot in action:

## Challenges and Limitations

* One challenge I faced was optimizing the chatbot's responses to be more accurate.
* I overcame this by using a combination of machine learning techniques and natural language processing algorithms.

## Future Plans and Ideas

I'd like to explore using other machine learning models to improve the chatbot's performance. I'm also interested in integrating the chatbot with other services, such as voice assistants.

## Feedback and Contributions

If you have any feedback or suggestions for improvement, please let me know! I'm open to contributions and collaborations.
